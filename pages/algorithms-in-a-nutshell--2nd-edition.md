## 2. The Mathematics of Algorithms



It helps determine the largest problem instance that can be handled by a particular algorithm implementation (Bentley, 1999). ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781491912973/ch02.html#5a1830ca-1535-4038-a2e9-a70f4603f48f))


Therefore, they assert that performance costs that differ by a multiplicative constant are asymptotically equivalent, or in other words, will not matter as the problem size continues to grow.
