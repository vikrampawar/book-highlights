# Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software

## One. Crunching Knowledge



But as the project proceeded, any of us could take terms straight out of the model, organize them into sentences consistent with the structure of the model, and be unambiguously understood without translation.

## I: Putting the Domain Model to Work



Creating a lucid model that cuts through that complexity is exciting. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/0321125215/part01.html#f9a44405-2bae-47f0-98f8-b3fb9dba8ce6))


This book will show that domain development holds opportunities to cultivate very sophisticated design skills. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/0321125215/part01.html#341d4363-c1c1-4dc5-ab40-5b55b698eee7))


Domain work is messy and demands a lot of complicated new knowledge that doesn’t seem to add to a computer scientist’s capabilities. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/0321125215/part01.html#ed2abcfd-e68c-4d80-9e95-be5312b4f1b7))


Developers have to steep themselves in the domain to build up knowledge of the business. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/0321125215/part01.html#d0a3540a-76f3-4e68-a5d5-5316f513ac06))


The heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related problems for its user.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/0321125215/part01.html#1d06b611-66e9-4872-b143-255ffea40065))


It is not just the knowledge in a domain expert’s head; it is a rigorously organized and selective abstraction of that knowledge.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/0321125215/part01.html#a5eb5982-c91b-4405-ab8a-aaf54bba6143))


A model is a selectively simplified and consciously structured form of knowledge. An appropriate model makes sense of information and focuses it on a problem ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/0321125215/part01.html#d3de1240-b510-4b25-b89e-adc0008b01ee))

## Preface



And although fear of unanticipated requirements often leads to overengineering, the attempt to avoid overengineering can develop into another fear: a fear of doing any deep design thinking at all.

When complexity gets out of hand, developers can no longer understand the software well enough to change or extend it easily and safely. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/0321125215/pref03.html#bc21f324-196b-42b5-a1e9-c6a6715b129a))
