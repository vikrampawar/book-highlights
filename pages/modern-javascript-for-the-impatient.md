Prototypes are used to implement classes and inheritance, and to modify the behavior of objects after they have been instantiated. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780136502166/ch04.xhtml#1d3fb3af-0d5d-4717-a53a-8a68941d5a6d))


As you will see later in this chapter, prototypes can be chained. If the prototype doesn’t have a property, its prototype is searched, until the prototype chain ends. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780136502166/ch04.xhtml#5859e51a-e895-447e-8fc2-9d81ec373d97))
