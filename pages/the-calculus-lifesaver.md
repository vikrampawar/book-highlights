## 1 Functions, Graphs, and Lines



Just about the only time you don’t need to use parentheses is when the function is an exponential function—for example, if h(x) = 3x, then you can just write h(x2 + 6) = 3x2 + 6. You don’t need parentheses since you’re already writing the x2 + 6 as a superscript.

In other words, the inverse of the inverse is the original function ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781400835782/08_Chapter01.xhtml#322a759b-6cce-41a2-b692-71b62538a5af))


So, this leads us to the vertical line test: if you have some graph and you want to know whether it’s the graph of a function, see whether any vertical line intersects the graph more than once. If so, it’s not the graph of a function; but if no vertical line intersects the graph more than once, you are indeed dealing with the graph of a function.

So we have found that the domain is the set (?8, 13] except for the number 2. This set could be written as (?8, 13]{2}. Here the backslash means “not including.” ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781400835782/08_Chapter01.xhtml#36c9d883-e546-4b5f-9db1-f9e80899dcf6))


An interval of the form (a, b) is called open ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781400835782/08_Chapter01.xhtml#f928da87-a89c-4e59-825d-4932cc482d44))


An interval such as [a, b] is called closed. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781400835782/08_Chapter01.xhtml#dfe8c3df-a9cc-4c44-9340-cb1694a92a56))


a function must assign a unique output for each valid input ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781400835782/08_Chapter01.xhtml#404d80ff-2205-403a-a7b9-b21a1ef6b800))
