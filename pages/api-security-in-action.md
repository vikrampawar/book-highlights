# API Security in Action

[> Home](../README.md)
## front matter



. You can’t achieve security purely at an architectural level, by adding boxes labelled “authentication” or “access control.” You must understand exactly what you are protecting and the guarantees those boxes can and can’t provide. On the other hand, security is not the place to reinvent everything from scratch. In this book, I hope that I’ve successfully trodden a middle ground: explaining why things are the way they are while also providing lots of pointers to modern, off-the-shelf solutions to common security problems.
