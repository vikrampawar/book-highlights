# Drawing for Interior Design, 2nd Edition

## Introduction



There appears to be a clear correlation between the success of designers’ work and the rigour of their working methods.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#1730d127-d9a5-4241-b167-54cb63233c65))


3D modelling makes it quite feasible to produce bespoke door furniture and other components hitherto sourced from manufacturers’ catalogues.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#49101a7e-9fc2-4e7c-b72b-c53584ba3392))


Already there are examples of intricate CNC- produced mouldings that may encourage a return to the use of ornament in interiors. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#bffe28af-2a58-4775-aeee-cf537c3573cc))


One significant example of this is BIM (building information modeling ), a process for the generation and management of production information,  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#f7c1264b-b9d5-4fe2-b0ab-458f1daf2f70))


just as images made on different hardwares and softwares can appear very similar (as do drawings made by hand), so the basic steps in creating them are essentially the same ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#a495a1a3-77de-4275-af91-1b3d8a4ec7cf))


The computer-made image is the most effective way of representing materiality and atmosphere ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#b85d4659-c340-4d5c-81de-78f52a7a00db))


A critical eye, rather than the computer or the hand, is what makes a drawing good.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#70a6a1b1-8d09-42b9-abae-adaa394ac000))


However, using computers it is comparatively simple to represent these essentials with a great – sometimes unsettling – degree of realism. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#c682c2d1-66a6-453f-9082-5328a5965a61))


The act of drawing structures thinking and the coherent progression of ideas.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#b0a0fb7a-5e24-40c9-8e65-38068b4f2495))


Designing is, in effect, the pursuit of that image: a succession of attempts to define it more precisely, to give it form, to examine it and assess its worth, to make progressively more objective decisions that finalize ideas and to  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/06_introduction-title.html#21f57511-0a18-44e9-9f46-7c01ee900f88))

## Chapter 1: The basics



Plans are essentially horizontal sections nominally drawn at 1200mm (4 feet) above floor level, which means that they cut through most windows and therefore include these crucial elements.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/07_chapter-title-1.html#7ca9a7f9-a248-4910-89e0-d9a9e1329a24))


The intersection of the arcs, which represent the length of the wall from B to C and the diagonal from A, locate corner C.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/07_chapter-title-1.html#e5c23e8e-9d0d-4aff-9e6b-79f8f58a5fb2))


The ‘running’ dimensions for each wall are normally taken from the left-hand corner as one looks at the wall.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781780676517/07_chapter-title-1.html#11c96119-3cdb-4c74-a864-b54aa13fd990))


A diagonal, together with the two walls it connects, represents the sides of a triangle, and when these are drawn to scale the angle of the intersection of the walls is established automatically and accurately.

Hand-held laser measuring devices, which provide a perfectly straight line at any height and eliminate this problem, are increasingly replacing the traditional tape measuring tools and, with their inbuilt digital programming, they can also calculate areas and volumes.
