. In the end the code is the model and the model is the code ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134434964/ch02.html#db3ed426-a9c9-4ff7-be64-883b68929052))


Both developers and Domain Experts should reject any tendency to allow documents to rule over conversation ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134434964/ch02.html#0936651f-896f-46ad-94b2-6e948b63577c))


Still, you are using DDD because the business model is more complex than the technical aspects of the project. That’s why the developers have to dig into the business model with Domain Experts!

## Chapter 1. DDD for Me



Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer—that the designers are handed this box and told, “Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

In Scrum, knowledge acquisition is done through experimentation and collaborative learning and is referred to as “buying information” [Essential Scrum].  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134434964/ch01.html#f17ef965-9041-4f07-bec8-82a34d669c42))


One model employed minimal, base intellect. The other model exploited maximum cognition. Software can be modeled from either perspective ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134434964/ch01.html#766987af-1e71-47bc-9480-3a3b4145fdff))


These makeshift thoroughfares aren’t traveled today because they were well designed, but because they exist ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134434964/ch01.html#e5082a5f-b2a5-48e0-9a92-4453bfe85a7e))

Questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134434964/ch01.html#3d065d31-13c2-4a10-8bfa-beb55e3e5026))


This all seems to happen in the spirit of “no design yields lower-cost software.”  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134434964/ch01.html#f460c8d0-38c5-4ba4-ab74-c253f6663764))


Developers are too wrapped up with technology and trying to solve problems using technology rather than careful thought and design.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134434964/ch01.html#141e279f-2f6c-4850-96f3-69e947e46f1a))
