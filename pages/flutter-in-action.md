## Chapter 1. Meet Flutter



Everything is widgets inside widgets inside widgets.  ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781617296147/kindle_split_011.html#492d7144-160c-4d0b-afca-7c33238c7123))

n a nutshell, you build a mobile UI by composing together a bunch of smaller components called widgets. Everything is a widget, and widgets are just Dart classes that know how to describe their view ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781617296147/kindle_split_011.html#d0e1175e-c57f-496d-86cf-2aad7a6a3a9a))


Are you an individual developer working on a side project or new product? Then the answer is simple: yes. This is absolutely for you. The amount of time you’ll spend getting up to speed with Dart and Flutter will pay off big time in the long run. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781617296147/kindle_split_011.html#eff26223-f038-47d6-8e54-df88950be567))


Flutter compiles to actual native code and is rendered using the same engine that Chrome uses to render (called Skia), so there’s no need to translate Dart at runtime. This means apps don’t lose any performance or productivity when running on a user’s device.

The biggest is called the JavaScript bridge. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781617296147/kindle_split_011.html#b3ca8c61-ce7d-4994-9775-299eb4423b87))


Flutter is for people who want to build an app quickly that doesn’t sacrifice performance. By speed, I mean the speed at which you can write code and iterate, and the speed at which Flutter builds. Thanks to hot reloading, Flutter rebuilds your application in sub-second time as you’re developing ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781617296147/kindle_split_011.html#54bd9760-7adc-4f48-b089-a7abba00754e))


If you need to build an MVP fast, and iterate quickly, Flutter just works. ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781617296147/kindle_split_011.html#e2ecc7b3-25e6-4784-8e21-e3732be05661))


a few functional programming features that make it easier to turn your data into pieces of UI. Finally, asynchronous, stream-based programming features are first-class citizens in Dart ([link](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781617296147/kindle_split_011.html#e75d6b9b-7cfe-4930-b031-c7e4ed459a4f))
